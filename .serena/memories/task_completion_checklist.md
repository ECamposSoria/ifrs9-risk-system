# IFRS9 Risk System - Task Completion Checklist

## Code Development Completion Steps

### 1. Code Quality Checks
```bash
make lint               # Run flake8 and mypy checks
make format             # Format code with black
```
**Requirements:**
- No linting errors from flake8
- No type checking errors from mypy  
- Code properly formatted with black (100 char line length)

### 2. Testing Requirements
```bash
make test               # Run full test suite with coverage
make test-rules         # Run specific rules engine tests
make validate-test-env  # Ensure test environment is properly set up
```
**Requirements:**
- All tests passing
- Maintain or improve code coverage
- Test environment validated

### 3. Integration Testing
```bash
make validate           # Validate configuration files
make generate-data      # Test synthetic data generation
make run-pipeline       # Test pipeline execution
```

### 4. Documentation Updates
- Update relevant docstrings for new/modified functions
- Update README.md if new features added
- Update architecture docs if system design changed

### 5. Environment Validation
```bash
make ps                 # Check service status
make show-ports         # Verify services are accessible
```

### 6. Pre-Commit Verification
- Verify Docker containers build successfully
- Ensure no hardcoded secrets or credentials
- Check that .env.example is updated if new environment variables added

## Deployment Readiness Checklist

### 1. Service Health
```bash
make up                 # Start all services
make logs               # Check for any error messages
```

### 2. Data Pipeline Validation
- Synthetic data generation works
- IFRS9 rules engine processes data correctly
- ML models training and prediction functional
- Airflow DAGs can be triggered successfully

### 3. Security Verification
- No sensitive data in logs
- Environment variables properly configured
- All services use secure communication

## Critical Components to Verify
1. **IFRS9 Rules Engine** - Core business logic compliance
2. **ML Models Pipeline** - Model training and prediction accuracy  
3. **Data Validation** - Input data quality checks
4. **Airflow Integration** - Workflow orchestration
5. **Docker Services** - All containers healthy and communicating

## When Task is Complete
- [ ] All code quality checks pass
- [ ] Full test suite passes with good coverage
- [ ] Integration tests successful
- [ ] Documentation updated
- [ ] Services running healthy
- [ ] No security issues identified
